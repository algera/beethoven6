# Beethoven 6th Symphony - Pastoral

This score is written for Sibelius (https://www.avid.com/sibelius) and should match 1:1 with both the full orchestral score and piano reduction.

## Why does this exist?
I started by transcribing the piano reduction into Sibelius. I then attempted to re-orchestrate from the piano back into the full orchestra four bars at a time. At the end of the four bars, I would go back and check my orchestration with Beethoven's original score. Effectively, this was a personal exercise in orchestration. 

## Why is this on GitHub?
Once I notated the score, I found it useful because you can isolate any single or group of instruments. You can change any note by pitch or rhythm and experiment with the original score. It's really quite interesting to hear, for example, all of the woodwinds played by chimes and strings by electric guitars. You can do some more advanced techniques like applying retrograde and inversion across the whole score just to hear what could be.  It's a great tool for tinkering. 

## Why are there only 100 bars?
I will gladly add more if this is useful for a growing group of people. The first 100 bars served its initial purpose for me and I may try the same with other composers shortly.
